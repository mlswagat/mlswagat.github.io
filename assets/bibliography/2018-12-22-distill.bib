abstract = {Information security is dependent on various access control mechanism governed by cryptography or the art of encryption and decryption. Cryptography is the largely built in computer hardware or in software using various discrete structure. Security is, thus, merging in network with cryptography to provide secure communication between trusted and/or untrusted network. Efficient mechanism of encryption process is a primary method of protecting valuable electronic information. The encryption process also needs to be dynamic in order to face new hazards and advance methods used by cryptanalysts. RC4 is one of the most popular and efficient stream ciphers [1]. Stream ciphers are often used in applications where high speed and low delay are a requirement. This paper proposes to identify the security requirements for data stream systems; according to the increasing order of robustness. Various security circumstances demand various degree of security robustness. This paper suggests to develop a family of cryptographic algorithm based on the RC4 and checks on the performance of each one to analyze the robustness so that the particular algorithm becomes readily applicable to a circumstance. The applicability of algorithm is totally governed by the requirement of robustness for the security concern of the circumstance. The security concern of robustness of circumstances is matched against the designed ciphersuites where such family of algorithms is available. The process of selection of ciphersuites and hence the cryptographic algorithm is automated in order to ensure appropriate circumstantial robustness. This analysis shows that, the full-size RC4 remains secure against known attacks [2]. The family of algorithm considered here is based on RC4. The basic RC4 algorithm and its variants suggested by different authors like RC4 KSA [3], RC4-PRGA are included in the family. In order enhance the degree of security robustness, two new algorithm S-RC41 and S-RC42 are proposed. Addition of variants of RC4 increases the range of automatic selection ensuring further enhancement in security. RC4 family is analyzed for encryption, decryption and algorithm strength is analyzed. Robustness is determined considering both the factors; speed of encryption/decryption or performance and algorithm strength. It is proposed to evaluate the effect of existing RC4 changing different parameters.}
